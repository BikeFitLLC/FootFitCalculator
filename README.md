### Analytics

* Log in to google analytics as bikefitapps@gmail.com
* Note: the debug build does not send any analytics events
* Note: the iPhone events from Dec 2016 are 'spam' events.  Subsequently, Matt created a filter to block all traffic from Country = Russia, but George removed it Feb 2017, since the recommendation is you have at least one view that contains all traffic.

### How do I find it in the Play Store?

* The app is called "The Foot Fit Calculator" in the play store.
